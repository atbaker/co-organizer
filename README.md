# co-organizer
A small web app to help meetup organizers get attendees into their events.

I'm building this app on livecoding.tv - follow along with me! https://www.livecoding.tv/atbaker/

## Key Features

- Connects meetup attendees to meetup organizers when they call my Twilio number the day of an event
- Configurable by SMS - it asks you who your other organizers are, when your next meetup is, etc.
    - It should identify and save the organizer by the first message it receives
    - Ask for other organizers next
